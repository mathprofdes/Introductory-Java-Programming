Since the discovery of public key cryptography in 1976, cryptography has relied
extensively on algebraic number theory, specifically on the properties of rings
and fields. The world's e-commerce system would not exist without the RSA
algorithm, the most commonly used encryption and authentication algorithm,
which utilizes these algebraic structures. Furthermore, the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), one of the most common symmetric cyphers, attributes its speed
and security to the structure of factor rings, similar to those we have
studied.

While these methods are secure by today's standards, with the ever increasing
computational power of the computer, they will eventually need to be replaced.
Research by Nobel Prize winners, David J. Wineland and Serge Haroche, suggests
that if the quantum computer is successfully built then new cryptographic
algorithms must be found. In short, none of the current cryptographic methods
currently used in practice will stand up to the computational power of the
quantum computer.

With this realization, there is a substantial amount of research being done on
post-quantum cryptography; cryptographic methods that will not succumb to the
power of the quantum computer. Many of the most promising methods being
developed utilize the multiplicative group of units in ring structures, such as
the ones we have studied. My research has produced concise formulas for
determining the cyclic group decomposition of the multiplicative group of units
for a large class of quotient rings closely related to those currently being
used and those that are proposed for future cryptographic methods.
